# Welcome to Nishiki Project Document

This is Nishiki's document.
Nihiki is developing for saving your food.

Do you know what is contained in your refrigerator correctly?
I have experienced that I bought some food that I had already bought, or I missed buying food that I had thought those remained in the refrigerator.

Using Nishiki, you don't need to worry about it!
Nishiki manages what foods are in the refrigerator for you and your partner. 

## Features

### Manage your refrigerator

Nishiki manages your refrigerator for you.
But not only for you, you can share it with your partner, friends, and so on.
You no longer need to ask your partner what food remains in your refrigerator or worry about duplicates of the same food when you have a party. 

### Shopping list (scheduled to be implemented)

During cooking, you might realize the sugar is running out. 
You can add "Sugar" to your shopping list on Nishiki, and then you can buy sugar when you go shopping. 
You don't need to worry about forgetting to buy.

### Recipe suggestions (scheduled to be implemented)

You might want to consume food that is nearing its expiration date, or you might want to challenge a new menu.
Nishiki suggests a recipe for you.
