# Welcome to Nishiki Project Document

This is Nishiki's document.
Nishiki is a solution for food management.

Do you ever find yourself unsure about what's in your fridge?
Perhaps you've bought groceries you already had or forgot to buy ones you thought were still in the fridge.

With Nishiki, you no longer need to worry about this!
Nishiki manages the inventory of your fridge for both you and your partner.

## Features

### Manage your fridge

Nishiki not only manages your fridge for you, but it also enables you to share it with your partner, friends, and more.
You'll no longer need to ask your partner about the food in your fridge or worry about having duplicate food when you buy groceries for a party.

### Shopping list (upcoming feature)

While cooking, you may suddenly discover that you're running low on sugar. 
With Nishiki, you can simply add "Sugar" to your shopping list, and then purchase it when you go shopping, ensuring that you won't forget to purchase it when you go shopping.

### Recipe suggestions (upcoming feature)

You might want to consume food that is nearing its expiration date, or you might want to challenge a new menu.
Nishiki suggests a recipe for you.
