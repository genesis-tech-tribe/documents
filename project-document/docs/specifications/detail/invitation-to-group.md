## How to invite to group

The invitation to a group is enabled by sharing an invitation link.

1. The user wanting to invite others to the group generates an *invitation link*.
2. The user shares this link with other users using suitable method.
3. When a user receives the invitation link and click on it, then they can join the group.

## Invitation link

The invitation link's specification is the following:

* Each link is identified by a unique hash value.
* The links expire 24 hours after they are generated.
* If a previous link is still valid, its expiry is overridden to 24 hours instead of generating a new link.
* If there is no previous valid link, a new link is generated.
